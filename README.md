# Drip-my-bru
Print files to build [WeighMyBru](https://weighmybru.com/) as a drip tray cover.
Instructions and parts list soon but should use the same parts as [WeighMyBru](https://weighmybru.com/) for the most part, execptions are double sided tape at least 25mm wide for touch sensor mounting and a 752248 or 102050 lipo battery.
I personaly recomend building with the Xaio S3 but will also support mounting the SuperMini, currently no power switch so SuperMini may have unexceptable battery life, the Xaio gives me about a week pulling one shot per day on avrage.
Better power managment is in the works for [WeighMyBru](https://weighmybru.com/) so im hopeful this will only improve in time and may make the SuperMini a bit more usable with batterys of this size but may add a switch anyway.

This is made to work with the [Loogle low profile drip tray](https://www.printables.com/model/869987-low-profile-drip-tray-gaggia-classic-pro-eco-evo
) found on Printables

Print the normal plate and if it has the tilt print “tilt fix.obj” at as low a layer height as you can, 0.08 is recommended. I would print a few at different orientations and pick the cleanest one.

Supermini parts are unprinted and untested that should allow the battery of either the supermini or the Xiao.

Recommended layer height is .2mm others seem to work as well.
