# Drip-my-bru
Print files to build WeighMyBru as a drip tray insert.

Print the normal plate and if it has the tilt print “tilt fix.obj” at as low a layer height as you can, 0.08 is recommended. I would print a few at different orientations and pick the cleanest one.

Supermini parts are unprinted and untested that should allow the battery of either the supermini or the Xiao.

Recommended layer height is .2mm others seem to work as well.
